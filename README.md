# pod-babashka-filewatcher

A [babashka pod](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods)
for watching files. Implemented using the Rust
[notify](https://github.com/notify-rs/notify) library.

## Install

The following installation methods are available:

- Download a binary from Github releases
- With [brew](https://brew.sh/): `brew install borkdude/brew/pod-babashka-filewatcher`

## Run

Run in [babashka](https://github.com/borkdude/babashka/) or using the
[babashka.pods](https://github.com/babashka/babashka.pods) library on the JVM.

``` clojure
(require '[babashka.pods :as pods])
(pods/load-pod "pod-babashka-filewatcher")

(require '[pod.babashka.filewatcher :as fw])

(fw/watch "/tmp" (fn [event] (prn event)) {:delay-ms 50}))
